I am the GIS Specialist for MIT Libraries, and am looking to enhance my programming and visualization skills. My favorite visualization is called the Mapdwell Solar System and was created for Boston, seen here: https://www.mapdwell.com/en/solar/boston. I like it because its a high spatial resolution map of Boston, its design fits the topic of solar energy, and not only do they map the data but they quantify it interactively. So basically we are seeing remote sensing, GIS, engineering, marketing, and design all in one.
