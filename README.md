02/11/17 - Welcome to Madeline Wrable's github website!

I am the GIS Specialist for MIT Libraries, and am looking to enhance my programming and visualization skills. My favorite visulaization is called the Mapdwell Solar System and was created for Boston, seen here: https://www.mapdwell.com/en/solar/boston. I like it because its a high spatial resolution map of Boston, its design fits the topic, the topic of solar energy interests me, and not only do they map solar energy but they quantify it interactively. So basically we are seeing remote sensing, GIS, engineering, marketing, and design all in one.
